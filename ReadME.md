# wrench box?

There are many simple functions, which we may have a lot of trouble with, while these functions are simple, but keeping them for later use will save us a lot of time. On the other hand, these functions may be the result of several hours of error-finding and searching in different sites, and it is really difficult to write them again.

*These functions are like a mechanical wrench for a programmer, and this repository is like a `wrench box`  for me.*
